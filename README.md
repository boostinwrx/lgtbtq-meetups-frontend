#  [LGBTQ+ Meet](https://lgbtq-meetups.herokuapp.com/) 
#### My Flatiron School Final Project (front-end)
 
## Visit web-application here: [LGBTQ+ Meet Link](https://lgbtq-meetups.herokuapp.com/) 

### This repository *only includes the front-end*, and is actively hosted on Heroku. See [Full LGBTQ+ Meet Repo](https://github.com/boostinwrx/LGBTQ-meetup-app) for the original repository including both the frontend and the backend.
 
 
 #### App Description:
* Finally, a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to create and find social meetups with gender affirming, supportive people near you!
  
* Everyone, no matter their sexual preference or gender identity, are welcome. Here, users can find meetups near them to hang out with like-minded people. Creating a meetup is effortless. Simply create an account, and create a custom meetup with a title, description, map location, date/time, and even a category (ex.transgender/lesbian/non-binary, etc.).
